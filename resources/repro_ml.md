> Background: Research results in artificial intelligence (AI)
are criticized for not being reproducible. Objective: To quantify the state of reproducibility of empirical AI research using six reproducibility metrics measuring three different degrees of reproducibility. Hypotheses: 1) AI research is not
documented well enough to reproduce the reported results. 2)
Documentation practices have improved over time. Method:
The literature is reviewed and a set of variables that should be
documented to enable reproducibility are grouped into three
factors: Experiment, Data and Method. The metrics describe
how well the factors have been documented for a paper. A total of 400 research papers from the conference series IJCAI
and AAAI have been surveyed using the metrics. Findings:
None of the papers document all of the variables. The metrics
show that between 20% and 30% of the variables for each factor are documented. One of the metrics show statistically significant increase over time while the others show no change.
Interpretation: The reproducibility scores decrease with increased documentation requirements. Improvement over time
is found. Conclusion: Both hypotheses are supported.
